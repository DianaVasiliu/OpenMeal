# OpenMeal

## About

**OpenMeal** is a project developed to learn about 3D concepts in computer graphics. For this, we created a 3D scene, where you can find a table ready for dinner.

The scene is illuminated, so that the 3D details can be easily distinguished, making the 3D effect more obvious. Also, the scene can be seen from different angles, controlling the camera with the keyboard.

## Resources

Most of the 3D models used were downloaded for free and eventually edited in Blender. The models are low-poly, so that they are loaded faster into the scene. All the download links for the models can be found [here](OpenMeal/Assets/resources.txt).
